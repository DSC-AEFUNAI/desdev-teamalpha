                    Abacha is one dish that always takes me back to a place and time. That place is Enugu in Nigeria and it represents most of
                    my childhood. I never bothered to learn how to make abacha until I left Enugu and couldn’t find good
                    abacha. It was always available from street vendors, warm and spicy served with fried fish and assorted
                    garnish. It is eaten mostly in eastern Nigeria and the Enugu people make the best! Abacha is made from
                    cassava root, which has been peeled, cooked, grated and dried. I guess this is a preservation method
                    to ensure that abacha was available all year round. I spent most Easter and summer holidays in the village
                    with my grandparents between ages 7-11, so I have had my fair share of harvesting and processing abacha
                    with my grandmother, I didn’t enjoy the farm part of it but peeling and cooking it was great fun. The
                    reward was enjoying the cooked freshly grated cassava soaked in water with some coconut!

                    Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients
                    such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another
                    dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines,
                    as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia and Malaysia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically
                    made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations.Fried rice first developed
                    during the Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to Chinese
                    fried rice.[1] Many varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. In Greater China,
                    common varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice. Japanese chāhan is considered

                    constructed Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean nasi goreng and Thai khao phat are popular dishes.
                    In the West, most restaurants catering to vegetarians have invented their own varieties of fried rice,
                    including egg fried rice."> Read More</a>

                    Some people call this dish African salad, I guess it’s the closest thing we have to a salad with only local ingredients.
                    Amala is mostly eaten in between meals, at hangout spots. I usually do not fry mackerel because I consider
                    it an oily fish and prefer to bake it but for Amala, I make an exception and its because I always had
                    it that way. There are different ways to make Amala, I love to make the ncha with palm oil and potash.
                    Some people do not like potash and prefer to fry the palm oil and make a sauce with all the ingredients
                    and add the Amala to it. I have listed the standard ingredients that make great Amala, don’t miss the
                    ugba I beg you! This dish can be eaten warm or cold, I prefer warm. In boarding school, we would soak
                    Amala; make the sauce in a bowl and toss it. It wasn’t great, it was cold, had no onions, fish or ugba
                    but it was the closest thing to home. This dish is really not complicated, all the
