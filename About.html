                <h3>ALPHA DELICACY</h3>
                <p>Alpha Delicacy is a resturant that provide food to the satisfaction of the customer, the name Alpha Delicacy
                    was first founded by a team of individals who call themselves Team Alpha and they are the ones who are
                    responsible for the buying and selling that has been going on in this restorant. Under the leadership
                    of Derek Emmanuel, they were able to prevail in the business. Alpha Delicacy specializes in different
                    types of foods which consist of both local foods, native food and international foods. Alpha Delicacy,
                    is made up of 7 individuals and their images will be shown below. Food is any substance[1] consumed to
                    provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and contains
                    essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested
                    by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate
                    growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their
                    unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.
                    Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
                    Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. Below
                    are some foods in Alpha Delicacy:Abacha is one dish that always takes me back to a place and time. That
                    place is Enugu in Nigeria and it represents most of my childhood. I never bothered to learn how to make
                    abacha until I left Enugu and couldn’t find good abacha. It was always available from street vendors,
                    warm and spicy served with fried fish and assorted garnish. It is eaten mostly in eastern Nigeria and
                    the Enugu people make the best! Abacha is made from cassava root, which has been peeled, cooked, grated
                    and dried. I guess this is a preservation method to ensure that abacha was available all year round.
                    Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually
                    mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself
                    or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian
                    and certain South Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia and Malaysia. As a homemade
                    dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless
                    variations.Some people call this dish African salad, I guess it’s the closest thing we have to a salad
                    with only local ingredients. Amala is mostly eaten in between meals, at hangout spots. I usually do not
                    fry mackerel because I consider it an oily fish and prefer to bake it but for Amala, I make an exception
                    and its because I always had it that way.

                <h3>WHAT IS FOOD</h3>
                <p>Food is any substance[1] consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant,
                    animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins,
                    or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide
                    energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours
                    that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche
                    within specific geographical contexts. Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain
                    food in many different ecosystems. Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting
                    and gathering and agriculture. As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture
                    lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography. Geographic and cultural
                    differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients,
                    herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes. As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade
                    and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural
                    origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices. Today, the majority
                    of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the industrial
                    food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food
                    processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil
                    fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate
                    change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions.[2]
